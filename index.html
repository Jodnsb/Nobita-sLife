	<h1 class="h1">True Story Behind Nobita's Life</h1>
	<p class="p">Nobita Hiroshi, a 9-year-old boy from Japan, seemed healthy and happy like any other boy his age, except Nobita was hiding a secret
	 from the world. He was suffering from schizophrenia, a disease which makes one see things that do not exist. So real they seem to the 
	 victim that they absolutely refuse to believe that it isn't true. Thus, the seemingly lonely and misunderstood Nobita created, in his 
	 mind, the adorable Doraemon that would give him everything he ever wanted and more. Being alienated in school, being misunderstood 
	 everywhere else and thanks to his schizophrenic mind, Doraemon became his best friend, the only friend who would understand him. 
	And thus Doraemon came to be, a toy comes to life who would never bother or irritate Nobita. Such was Nobita's dependence on Doraemon,
	 whom he imagined would give him all sorts of weird gadgets to do stuff with, that when Nobita was told by the doctors that Doraemon 
	 was not real, he simply could not take it. <br>

<br>
When he was 16 years old, the Hiroshi family finally took him to the doctors who dismissed the existence of Doraemon, prompting Nobita to take the extreme step. He took his own life with his father's gun, refusing to exist in a world that disregarded his own.
